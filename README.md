For this project i build a personal portfolio site to put all project i will make in the FRONT-END Nanodegree Course.

This repository has two main branches: master and gh-pages.

> **master**: Here are all the files in production and distribution.

> **gh-pages**: They are only the distribution files needed to properly display the web page.
